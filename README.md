Small util allowing to print the Star Citizen joystick keybinds,
directly updated by reading the exported `layout.xml`.

## Setup

- an editable `pdf` (ie a form)
  - MUST have all the required text forms with the correct labels
- an exported `xml` eg `layout_vkb_custom_v1_exported.xml` from Star Citizen containing the keybinds
- example: if the keybind in `xml` is `js1_button5`, the `pdf` MUST have a label `button5`(or `js1_button5`)
